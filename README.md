# NebulaInjector
This is the official release repository for NebulaInjector. NebulaInjector is a dll injection software intended for usage on Enoughs Menu, more precisely enoughs.dll. 

For more information contact Sojournercntl on Discord or Steam. Support requests will be handled by me. For this please visit [enoughs forum](https://enoughindustries.com/)

## Installation and Requirements
For the first installation you simply need to [download](https://enoughindustries.com/) the newest version of the injector.
#### Step 1
Extract the downloaded file (When downloaded as archive) to an folder you prefer. You can also simply drop it into the desktop.

#### Step 2
**Start Grand Theft Auto 5**. Remember the Injector does Inject the hack into an already running process. NebulaInjector does not start the process for you.
**Run NebulaInjector** as administrator. If this does not work go to the compatibility settings and check the box "run as administrator".

#### Step 3
When having the newest version running for the first time you are prompted to **download** or **locate** enoughs.dll.

![Download / Locate](https://github.com/sojournercntl/NebulaInjector/blob/master/ResourcesReadme/Step3.PNG)

In case you never had the dll or you want to download it because its easier, click **Download**.

#### Step 4
Take a look at the right sidebar with the small green icons. If one of them is not green you should try to find out why!

##### Sidebar description
The first Icon shows the **verification status**. If the dll is signed and authenticated this icon will be green. In case it shows up with a red color you are not using the actual verified version.

The second Icon indicates the **application state**. The application state will only be checked in the start-up routine. Therefore you should start Process you want to inject to before starting the injector.  Red means the application is not running. Green means its running.

The third one indicates if your **system architecture** supports the cheats architecture. If this shows up red, contact the tech support.

The last icon represents the **ready-state**. Green tells you that the injector is ready for injection and that you can now press the inject button without any problems.
#### Step 5
Click the inject button and wait one or two seconds. Once the library has been injected NebulaInjector will close itself after 10 seconds.
